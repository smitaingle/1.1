5.  Problem Statement 
1. Please mention true or false for the below statements:
 a) Prescriptive Analytics is used to predict the future outcomes 
 Ans : False
  Explanation : Prescriptive analytics - uses optimization techniques and suggests what should be done to optimize result
				example• Retail stores usually run clearance sale by reducing the prices to finish their inventory The question is: When to reduce the price and by how much?
				• Descriptive analytics: examine historical data for similar products (prices, units sold, advertising etc.)
				• Predictive analytics: predict sales based on price by analyzing historical sales data
				• Prescriptive analytics: find the best sets of pricing and advertising to maximize sales revenue
 b) Base R packages are installed automatically
Ans : True 
Explanation: Base pkg made R a programming language
				example : some functions from base pkgSys.time                Get Current Date and Time		
				[.data.frame            Extract or Replace Parts of a Data Frame		
				[.factor                Extract or Replace Parts of a Factor		
				all.equal               Test if Two Objects are (Nearly) Equal		
				as.data.frame           Coerce to a Data Frame		
 
2.  What is Recycling of elements   in a vector? 
	Recycling of elements is the repeating of elements of small vector to match the length of long vector, when applying an OPERATION to 2 vectors 
	which require same no. of elements or length of vectors.
 
3. Give an example of recycling of elements. 
> #example of recycling of elemnets of vector
> v1 <- c(1,2,3)
> v2 <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
> v1+v2
[1] 2 4 6 5 7
Warning message:
In v1 + v2 :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
